    para:["Dental implants have helped restore the smiles of millions of people across the globe and are currently the most sought-after intervention for tooth loss. Whether the missing tooth is the result of a genetic condition, tooth decay, gum disease, or injury, dental implants offer a reliable smile makeover.","They feel, look, and function like a natural tooth. Even more important, they are designed to last a lifetime under proper care and maintenance."]

    title:"What are dental implants?",
    para:["Dental implants were first invented by Per-Ingvar Brånemark, a Swedish Orthopaedic surgeon, to mimic the roots of the real teeth. During the tooth implant process, a surgical fixture (also called the post) is implanted deep inside the jawbone. A connector is then fixed onto the post. Then, a crown or dental bridge is fitted over the connector to cover the space left by the missing teeth. Modern-day tooth implants are made of titanium since the metals are readily accepted by the body.","Dental implants are shaped like screws and are driven inside the jawbone during dental implant surgery. After which, usually a couple of months, the area will heal, and bone deposition begins to occur around the post. It only takes one to two years for the metal screw to fuse permanently onto the jawbone and form a root-like structure.","Dental implants can effectively replace multiple missing teeth or a single tooth. They are popular because these dental solutions for missing teeth are safe and do not interfere with neighbouring teeth during installation or cause bone deterioration in the jaw. They also support dentures and bridges."]

    para:["So far, there are only two popular types of dental implants that are ideal tooth replacement options. They include:","Endosteal implants-this is the most popular option that is a preferred alternative for all patients with healthy gum and jaw bone. In this dental implant procedure, the dentist digs a hole inside the jawbone and fits the post or cylinder deep inside. Once the area has healed, the surgeon or dentist will fix a crown or bridge upon it.","Subperiosteal implants-this type is used when the jawbone is unhealthy. If the jawbone hurts or is infected, the surgeon will not fit the implant directly. Instead, a metal frame is fixed to connect the jawbone to the post. Then, the gum is allowed to heal as the post integrates into the jawbone. Once both have healed and are stable enough, the dental specialist embeds the bridge or crown onto the crown whilst allowing it to protrude through the gum."]

    title:"Why dental implants?",
    para:["Apart from being the only viable teeth replacement option that gives patients a more natural tooth, dental implants come with a range of benefits. To begin with, full dental implants are pain-free artificial teeth designed to last a lifetime. They hardly interfere with the neighbouring teeth since you don’t have to wear them like braces. They also support dentures and bridges and can be fixed should an accident arise.","Dental implants keep the shape of the gum by preventing recession. Neither do they interfere with the structure and composition of the jawbone like bridges and dentures.","Once fully healed, you can use the artificial teeth much the same like you use other natural teeth for biting, speaking, and chewing. Visit us today at Bayswater Dentist, and you’ll be sure to recover your smile and confidence right away."]
